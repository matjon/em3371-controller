//      https://community.grafana.com/t/preset-time-frames-broken-shows-no-data-points-date-is-5-hours-ahead/10683/9
//      Our intention have never been to support anything else than UTC on Grafana and UTC in
//      database/storing timestamps in actual UTC time in database. Unfortunately this have worked
//      for you unintentionally before. Hopefully we can find a way to manage multiple timezones in
//      dashboard/datasource in the future.
//
//      When the data disappears when zooming in, this is likely to be a timezone issue.
